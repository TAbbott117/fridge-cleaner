## For those about to rot, we salute you.

### We've all been there - you went grocery shopping early in the week and loaded up on fresh produce, ready to step up your meal prepping game. You use your favorites, cook up some delicious dishes. But then you see the chard wilting in the crisper, or the unused block of feta nearing its end. What are you to do with these leftover ingredients, just waiting to spoil?

### With Fridgable, this classic first-world problem is solved! Make your account, build your fridge, find your recipes, and put those ingredients into your mouth, not into the trash!
